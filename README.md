# A Simple Dashboard with Tailwind CSS ðŸš€

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This is just a little practice project where I'm trying out Tailwind CSS to build a dashboard. It's part of my learning journey with Phitron's Software Development Program (SDP) Frontend course, specifically from Module 3.5 of Week 3 (which I think is Milestone 1!).

## What is this project?

It's a simple, static dashboard layout. I used Tailwind CSS to style everything without writing any custom CSS (which is pretty cool!). The goal was to get a feel for how Tailwind works, like using utility classes for styling elements and making them responsive.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** For the basic structure of the dashboard.
* **Tailwind CSS:** This is the star of the show! I'm using the CDN version for now just to quickly see how things work.

## Features (or what I tried to build)

* **Responsive Header:** With a small menu button for mobile (though it doesn't do anything yet, haha!).
* **Stat Cards:** Showing some dummy numbers like "Total Task" and "Completed Task".
* **Today's Tasks List:** A simple list of things to do.
* **All Tasks Table:** A basic table displaying task details with priority and team members.

## How to Check it Out

1.  **Clone this repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/MushfiqPlabon/dashB-tail-phi.git](https://github.com/MushfiqPlabon/dashB-tail-phi.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the `index.html` file** in your web browser. That's it!

Since I'm using the Tailwind CSS CDN, you don't need any special build steps or node modules. Just open the HTML file directly!

## What I Learned (so far!)

* How to quickly style HTML elements using Tailwind's utility classes.
* The concept of responsive design with Tailwind's breakpoints (`sm`, `lg`, etc.).
* That building UIs with utility-first CSS is a whole new way of thinking!
